D/EASYVK: [Vulkan]: Validation: Validation Error: [ VUID-VkShaderModuleCreateInfo-pCode-04147 ] Object 0: handle = 0xb2976000, type = VK_OBJECT_TYPE_DEVICE; | MessageID = 0x3d492883 | vkCreateShaderModule(): The SPIR-V Extension (SPV_KHR_storage_buffer_storage_class) was declared, but none of the requirements were met to use it. The Vulkan spec states: If pCode declares any of the SPIR-V extensions listed in the SPIR-V Environment appendix, one of the corresponding requirements must be satisfied (https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/html/vkspec.html#VUID-VkShaderModuleCreateInfo-pCode-04147)

But VkNonDispatchableHandle 0xd897d90000000016[] doesn't set VK_SHADER_STAGE_COMPUTE_BIT. The Vulkan spec states: layout must be consistent with the layout of the compute shader specified in stage (https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/html/vkspec.html#VUID-VkComputePipelineCreateInfo-layout-00703)
